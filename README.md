## R Code - 
Creates a Shiny App showing a graphic relationship between 2 variables.

I use this for helpnig to make meaningful categories from continuous variables in relation to an explanatory variable.
Mostly for preparing data variables prior to running a logistic regression.

Currently is dependant on ggplot2 but that can easily be tweaked
