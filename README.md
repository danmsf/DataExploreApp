# DataExploreApp
## R Code

R code that creates a Shiny App showing a graphic relationship between 2 variables.

## Includes:
* A Statistical Summary Table
* A histogram
* A a spline plot showing the relation between the 2 variables

## Main use

I use this to help make meaningfull categories from continuous variables in relation to an explanatory variable.   

Mostly for preparing data variables prior to running a logistic regression.

## Package Dependencies
* Is currently dependant on `ggplot2` but that can easily be tweaked
* And of course the `Shiny` package
